     **Auto Scaling **
What is Cloud Autoscaling? Autoscaling (sometimes spelled auto scaling or auto-scaling) is the process of 
automatically increasing or decreasing the computational resources delivered to a cloud workload based on need.

Scaling :- 
1) vertical scaling :- it can change instance types .(like c3,t2.micro,m3 etc)
 in that we have to stop the instances for doing this . in this process DOWNTIME faceing occurs.
2) Horizontal scaling :- it create  identical instances .(like t2.micro->t2.micro->t2.micro )

 --AUTOSCALING--
autoscaling has three types 
1)static autoscaling
2)dynamic autoscaling
2) scheduling autoscaling

Lets get started---

1)launch configration --> create lunch configration--> name ->
    AMI (open new ec2 tab, lauch instance in that open ami and copy ami id(ami-0cff7528ff583bf9a)) and paste in AMI opp in configration
    -> instance type (t2.micro) -> additional conf (no change)in that tap on Advance detail add script in user data 
             #!/bin/bash
             yum update -y
             yum install httpd -y
             echo"hey this is a function of :$HOSTNAME" > /var/www/html/index.html
             systemctl start httpd
             systemctl enable httpd
    -> storage (no change) ->security group (create new group)add rule ports http ssh and set to anywhere
    ->key pair (existing or new ) and acknowledge 
   -> create . DONE
2)NOW Autoscaling Groups 

 step 1)-> name -> launch configration (switch to launch config. and add your previous conf) then next
 step 2) ->vpc (default) -> availability zones  select 
 step 3) -)load balance opptional -> health check -> additional (opp) NEXT
 step 4) -> Group size these define (static (ex. desire 2,min 2,max 2) and dynamic (Desire 5, min 3, max 7)
              from this instance will create as per cpu runs more than 50% new server will create or say request more then instance will created to max
               if request is less then instance will decrease to minimum)
         -> Scaling policies (optional) so for now we set on NONE .
         -> instance scale in protection (opp) NEXT
 step 5) -> notification (opp)
 step 6) -> tags
 step 7) review and launch auto scaling group
 check instance ip on the browser .

 for extended web server ex. 44.33.234/kids
             yum update -y
             yum install httpd -y
             mkdir -p /var/www/html/kids/index.html
             echo "hey this is a function of :$HOSTNAME" > /var/www/html/kids/index.html
             systemctl start httpd
             systemctl enable httpd

 done scaling part now
Scheduling configration
 ->auto scaling group -> tap on which you want to schedule ->below go to Automatic scalling -> 
    below Scheduled action will show now -> create schedule action
