->autoscaling group -> name,choose lunch conf (home) ,same and launch (go to instance and change name to home)
->autoscaling group -> name,choose lunch conf (kids) ,same and launch (go to instance and change name to movie)
->autoscaling group -> name,choose lunch conf (movies) ,same and launch (go to instance and change name to movie)

-> load balancr (name,scheme(internet-facing),ipv4, mapping select all zones,add security group (two group need to add)
now in listner create tags so now iam creating 3 tags simultaneously for (home,kids,movies) select seprate 2 seprate 2 ., 2
-> 1)target group (name,basic conf(for instance),health check NEXT
   register target select 2 instance of home and include as pending below now tap on CREATE TARGET GROUP.
 ---so first target group created sucessfully
   2)sencond target group for kids same as per fist but only change is in that health check where we had to add path /kids than further same as above .
   3)sencond target group for kids same as per fist but only change is in that health check where we had to add path /movies than further same as above .

go back to lb tab and select home in target group in listner only one .
now create load balancer.

 go to lb and tap on that lb and ->tap on listner in that you find Rules->View/edit rule option ,open that ,
 apter opening + to add now go tto insert rule, add condition select(path)type /kids* in IF,and THEN select target group kids save .
again insert rule in IF add condition, add path /movies* , Then target group movies
 after this go to load balancer copy DNS and search on web
