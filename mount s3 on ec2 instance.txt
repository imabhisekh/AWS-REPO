How to Mount S3 bucket on EC2 Linux Instance


A S3 bucket can be mounted in a AWS instance as a file system known as S3fs. S3fs is a FUSE file-system that allows you to mount an Amazon S3 bucket as a local file-system. 
Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a simple interface for userspace programs to export a virtual file-system to the Linux kernel.
 
> For CentOS or Red Hat
# yum update all
-> For Ubuntu
# apt-get update
Step-2:- Install the dependencies.
-> In CentOS or Red Hat
# sudo yum install automake fuse fuse-devel gcc-c++ git libcurl-devel libxml2-devel make openssl-devel

In Ubuntu or Debian
# sudo apt-get install automake autotools-dev fuse g++ git libcurl4-gnutls-dev libfuse-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev make pkg-config

Step-3:- Clone s3fs source code from git.

# git clone https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse.git

Step-4:- Now change to source code  directory, and compile and install the code with the following commands:
# cd s3fs-fuse
# ./autogen.sh
# ./configure --prefix=/usr --with-openssl
# make
#sudo make install

Step-5:- Use below command to check where s3fs command is placed in O.S. It will also tell you the installation is ok.
# which s3fs

Step-6:- Getting the access key and secret key. ITS JUST FOR INFORMATION PROCEED FURTHER
Go to AWS Menu -> Your AWS Account Name -> My Security Credentials. Here your IAM console will appear.
You have to go to Users > Your Account name and under permissions Tab, check whether you have 
sufficient access on S3 bucket. If not, you can manually assign an existing  “S3 Full-Access” policy or 
create a new policy with sufficient permissions. 

Step-7 :- Create a new file in /etc with the name passwd-s3fs and Paste the access key and secret key in the below format .
# touch /etc/passwd-s3fs
# vim /etc/passwd-s3fs
Your_accesskey:Your_secretkey add this formate in that file

Step-8:- Change the permission of file
# sudo chmod 640 /etc/passwd-s3fs

Step-9:- Now create a directory or provide the path of an existing directory and mount S3bucket in it.
# mkdir /mybucket
# s3fs your_bucketnameins3 /mybucket/ -o passwd_file=/etc/passwd-s3fs
# df -h 
now create file here it will show on s3 bucket.
